regra de negocio é a preparação dos pedidos que é realizado pelo back-end
    that analogy where the front end is the client and the back end is the kichen and stuff

on the back end you verify. Exemple: im doing a cadastro and im putting the cpf. is the back end job to verify if its real 

the back end manipula all data like cadastro, the validation, etc

node.js is the responsible for "rodar" javascript na sua maquina.

a servidor is a computer somewhere in the world and inside of it there is our code using some inteligencia who will answer our orders

library means someone made something before and we used it

mistakes are normal here

now i only can acess if i create routes

__dirname shows our current paste

+ can add other text to the first one or do math on the js

static files and dynamic files

    static do not have dynamic change
        all the directories in public are static

    js is dynamic
    template engine can transform html in dynamic

http verbs (GET and POST)
    everytime i put my url on browser and send im doing a type GET request 

    POST everytime i want to save something of my application (on forms)

  // doing this the express will create all the routes that i need from public (line 9)

    template engine 

        {{#each orphanages }}
        <p> flskdfj </p>
        {{/each}} 
    
    this thing will make the p repeat depending on the object
    "for each orphanage copy this"
    to catch just one of them you put {{this}}
    esse this is a reference and them you call the atributos(?) with . : {{this.lat}}

if you don't know what the data is put a console.log
