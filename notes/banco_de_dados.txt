Isnt easy to find mistakes on sqlite so PAY ATTENTION it praticamente dont show your errors

INTEGER is a number

PRIMARY KEY means that the id is the identifier of the orphanage i put

AUTOINCREMENT means that it will put values automatically

object.properties

INSER INTO table_name (
    keys
    name,
    lat,
    lng,
    etc
) VALUES (
    
);

.then is a way to tell the javascript(?) to wait until the hole line was executed

if you put .then(async ) you can use just the word await to do the .until job

.all has the ability of search for us all the data we have on our database

SELECT * FROM table_name <- this means select all fields from the table
if i wantend to call just the names -> SELECT name FROM table_name

it will select all lines and columns

even though you deleted the table items it will comeback with a different id

delete all data from the table -> DELETE FROM table_name
delete one specific item -> DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id = 'x'
    x = any number (the id number of the thing you wanna delete)

//put database on application
