        NOTES ABOUT THE NLW CONTENT

A html tag cannot be open inside and closed outside of another html tag.
Ex: <head> 
     
    <body>

    </head>

    </body>

diretorio = pasta

./ is the root (pasta raiz)

html - skeletal structure
css - roupas, maquiagem, etc.

header (cabeçalho)

    absolute or relative way

relative ways are like this:
./some_past/other_past/etc

.svg is a type of image and its write on html 

strong is to put the text in bold

<main> is where you put the main stuff

In CSS the last thing you put is the strongest

If you put the css like an atributo in the html that will be the strongest 

To put the style on the internal archive will make it stronger than the ones on the external archive

If I put the style and then put the external link, the link will be the strongest. 

The strongest form is putting important like this:
 
 body {
     color: cyan important;
 }

    Selectors

# = id
. = class

function name(233, 55, 55); 
six numbers 345689.

the last one is a short way to do the upside part

    body, input, button, textarea {
        font-weight: 400;
        font-size: 18px;
        line-height: 1;
        font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;

        font: 400 18px/1 'Nunito', sans-serif;
    }

the rem or em will always look for the antecedent tag.
if you put body {
   font-size: 1.8em;
}
the tag will look for their's dad to see the patern font

but the rem will look for the root element!

when you put flex (i think its display) you transform everything in inline 

the next tag only can aling everything if the last item was a display flex

3 values on margin are up; both sides and bottom

to apply one more class you just put a space like this:
    <div class="location animate-up">

"main h1" is stronger than "h1"

try to put the css in the order of the html

to get out off a past you just need to put .. like this:
../
  
flex 1 means that the

one page has a display: flex; if i put a flex: 1; in a child of his that means he will adjust for all the space he has on the page

do the validation on front end before the person send

             discover the if ternario
function validate(needsLatAndLng) {
    
    //validate if lat and lng are filled
    const needsLatAndLng = true
    if(needsLatAndLng) {
        event.preventDefault()
        alert("Please select a place on map")
    }
    }
}
document.querySelector('lat, lng')
    //validady if lat and lng are field
    pegue o campo e verifique o value é vazio, se tiver você usa o event prevent default
    if
    event.preventDefault() 
    alert('Select a point on the map')

    if(needsLatAndLng) {
        do the challenge
        a boolean(?)
